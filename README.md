# Social_Media
It is a console application project, I use C++ (OOP) to create profiles of some social media websites like : LinkedIn and Twitter. There are some operations in this project like follow and unfollow, and it differs from a website to another so, I solved this problem by polymorphism concepts and override the functions in each class.
